Many of the current Nagios checks are version-specific, leaving organizations running multiple versions of MySQL no choice but to support multiple Nagios checks for the same services.  This program is designed to support all of the basic MySQL checks (including replication).  If there are additional checks that you'd like to see, please request them on the issues page.

Future Updates:
  * [check\_mysql\_all](check_mysql_all.md) - More Checks
  * [check\_maatkit](check_maatkit.md) - Nagios checks for Maatkit scripts
  * [check\_mmm](check_mmm.md) - Nagios checks for MMM
  * [check\_handlersocket](check_handlersocket.md) - Nagios checks for HandlerSocket
